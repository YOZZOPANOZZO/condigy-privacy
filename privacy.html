  <h1>Privacy Policy – Condigy</h1>
  <p>Condigy does not collect, store, transfer or sell any personal data from users.</p>
  <p>The extension only analyzes Amazon product pages and makes requests to Amazon domains to retrieve available conditions for the same product (e.g. New, Used, Second Hand).  
  All data processed is handled locally inside the user’s browser and is never sent to external servers.</p>
  <p>Condigy does not use cookies, trackers, fingerprinting techniques, or analytics tools.</p>
  <p>No information about users, browsing history, or Amazon accounts is collected or stored.</p>
  <p>If future updates require handling personal data, this privacy policy will be updated before such changes are introduced.</p>
